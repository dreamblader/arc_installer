# The Story

This was supposed to be an ARC-DPS installer and updater made with RUST (so I could learn a lit bit more the language). However, I found out that ARC-DPS auto-updates now... so...

Guild Wars 2!

It's been 4 years that I took a break from the game and now I'm back to it. Going Finally back to do some end-game content. However, all my end-game builds now are outdated. 

# The Problem

Sometimes we take a break from the game, or a new patch comes that change the entirety of the Build META and that's not a problem. However, the logistics of going through our multiple ascended chest in bank or trying to find out if we can equip X or Y because expansion X or Y starts to make having multiple ALTS a little nightmare.

# The Solution

HOPEFULLY THIS!
